ANSWERS:

Q1:
A program that handles with a numerous independent data structures, and has a very few system calls.
The reason that user level threads are a reasonable option for this kind of program is that the structures
are not related, therefore we can switch missions without losing information.
In addition there are no system calls that block the whole process.

Q2:
Advantages - each tab is independent and safe from other tabs.
Disadavantages - high overhead, communication between tabs is less efficient

Q3:


Q4:
Virtual time - the time that each thread\process actually runs on the CPU
Real time - the actual time that passes
For instance, in our program the virtual time doesn't include the time that we switch threads or have system calls.
