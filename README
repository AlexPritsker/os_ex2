ANSWERS:

Q1:
A program that handles with a numerous independent data structures, mostly arithmetic operations and has few system calls - Matlab for example.
In such case we can incrrease the overall program preformence.
Moreover, user level threads may be very usefull when threads need to get prioritized.
In addition there are no system calls that block the whole process.

Q2:
Advantages - each tab is independent and safe from other tabs.
Disadavantages - high overhead, communication between tabs is less efficient

Q3:


Q4:
Virtual time - the time that each thread\process actually runs on the CPU
Real time - the actual time that passes
For instance, in our program the virtual time doesn't include the time that we switch threads or have system calls.
